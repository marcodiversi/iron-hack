# So now, your job is to put this all together. We built the ingredient and milkshake classes, 
# now you have to build the shack shop class. Hereâ€™s some things you're going to need for this class:

# - An empty list where we can add milkshakes
# - A method to add milkshakes to this list
# - A method to checkout all of the milkshakes in our list

# Hint: Model this class in the same way we created the milkshake class, 
# and call the price_of_milkshake method to return a milkshakes total price when checking out.
